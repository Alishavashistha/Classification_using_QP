# ðŸ¤– SVM on Classification Data (Originally for Logistic Regression)

This project demonstrates how to apply a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to a dataset commonly used for **logistic regression**. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, the project shows how SVM can effectively separate binary classes using a linear or non-linear decision boundary.

## ðŸ“˜ File Description

- `svm on classification data for logistic regression.ipynb`:  
  A step-by-step Jupyter notebook that:
  - Loads a binary classification dataset
  - Applies SVM classification using `scikit-learn`
  - Visualizes the data, decision boundary, and support vectors
  - Optionally compares with logistic regression (if included)

## ðŸ§® Concepts Covered

- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Margin maximization and support vectors
- Binary classification on 2D data
- Visual comparison of SVM and logistic regression (if included)
- Use of kernel methods (if implemented)
